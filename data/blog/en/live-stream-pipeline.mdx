## 1. Streaming and Distribution Principles

A typical live streaming pipeline starts from the capture side, where audio and video are pushed via a `streaming protocol` to a server or CDN. The CDN then transcodes and repackages the stream into multiple protocol formats (e.g., FLV, HLS, HTTP-FLV, LLS) for viewers to pull and play.

Modern protocols (like SRT, RIST, E‑RTMP) and standard ones (RTMP, HLS, HTTP‑FLV, RTC) serve different purposes: some prioritize **ultra-low latency**, while others focus on **compatibility and large-scale delivery**.

- **Capture and Push**: The broadcaster typically uses RTMP to push streams, but SRT, RIST, or E‑RTMP can also be used. Upstream network quality affects push latency and stability.

  - **SRT** (Secure Reliable Transport): Based on UDP + ARQ retransmission; supports AES encryption and firewall traversal; typical latency ≈120 ms. Ideal for cross-network, high-reliability transmission.

  - **RIST** (Reliable Internet Stream Transport): Based on RTP/UDP + NACK; open standard focused on multi-vendor compatibility and low latency.

  - **E‑RTMP** (Enhanced RTMP): Extends RTMP with support for modern features such as AV1/HEVC, nanosecond timestamps, and multi-track audio.


- **Server / Transcoding / CDN**: Handles stream distribution and protocol conversion. Each protocol has a different processing model: HLS requires segmenting and indexing (introducing batch latency); RTMP transmits frame by frame (lower latency).

  - Receive protocol stream → Transcode into multiple bitrates (H.264, H.265, AV1, etc.)

  - Output formats on demand: FLV/HTTP‑FLV (second-level latency), HLS/LL-HLS (cross-platform), MPEG‑DASH/LL‑DASH, WebRTC (real-time interaction)

  - CDN handles segment caching (.ts/.m4s), index distribution (.m3u8/.mpd), and edge protocol relay.


- **Playback Client**: The player downloads, decodes, and renders the stream. Buffer size and decoding delay determine final latency. Players often buffer a few frames or seconds to smooth network fluctuations, which introduces extra delay.


## 2. Latency Composition and GOP Buffer Strategy

Total live latency is made up of three parts:

1. **Production Side**: Capture (10–30 ms), encoding (50–200 ms), preprocessing

2. **Network/CDN**: Transmission (≳ network RTT), segmentation & distribution (HLS segment duration × playlist length)

3. **Playback Side**: Player buffer (1–3 s), decoding, rendering, post-processing

The `GOP` (Group of Pictures) value defines the number of frames between keyframes (IDR), i.e., the maximum frame count in a group.

Clients usually buffer 1–2s of content to mitigate jitter. To balance startup speed and latency, two GOP buffer strategies are common:

- **Upper-Bound Priority** (Low Latency): No historical I-frame buffering; player waits for the next I-frame to begin playback (minimal delay).

- **Lower-Bound Priority** (Anti-Jitter): Buffers complete GOPs and starts playback immediately using the cached I-frame ("instant start"), at the cost of increased delay (≈1 GOP length).

Using [SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs) as an example, the gop_cache config toggles this strategy:

- gop_cache off: enables upper-bound priority (low-latency playback),
- gop_cache on: allows fast startup using buffered GOPs.

Toggle based on scenario—enable buffering to avoid black screens in poor networks, or disable to reduce delay when downstream is stable.


## 3. Protocol Mechanisms and Use Cases

- `RTMP` (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): Developed by Adobe/Flash, uses long-lived TCP connections to transmit FLV packets.
Pros: Low latency (1–3s), widely supported by capture devices and legacy players, firewall-friendly (often via port 80).
Cons: Requires plugins or dedicated players (modern browsers don’t support Flash), TCP may cause accumulated delay under poor network.
Use Cases: Interactive streams, PC-based streaming.

- `HTTP-FLV`: Streams FLV via continuous HTTP requests. Works similarly to RTMP—packages audio/video into FLV Tags and transmits over HTTP.

  - Pros: Uses standard HTTP (bypasses firewall), supports HTTPS, mobile-friendly.

  - Cons: Still based on TCP, requires a player or JS engine with HTTP-FLV support (not playable natively in browsers).

  - Use Cases: Web-based live streaming.

- `HLS` (HTTP Live Streaming): Apple’s segmented streaming protocol over HTTP. Server slices video into TS or CMAF segments and generates an M3U8 playlist.

  - Pros: Fully HTTP-based, firewall-traversable, CDN-friendly, simple client implementation.

  - Cons: Intrinsically high latency due to segment-based delivery; standard delay typically 5–15s. LL-HLS reduces latency to 3–5s via shorter segments and partial loading.

  - Use Cases: Video-on-demand and general-purpose live streaming.

- `LLS` (Low-Latency Streaming): Refers to proprietary low-latency solutions using fine-grained segments (e.g., CMAF/FLV hybrid) and push-based delivery.

  - Pros: Sub-second latency, real-time delivery at scale.

  - Cons: Vendor-locked, requires specific SDKs/players, higher deployment cost.

  - Use Cases: Large-scale live events requiring low latency.

- `RTC` (WebRTC): UDP-based real-time communication protocol using SRTP.

  - Pros: Ultra-low point-to-point latency (\<500ms), ideal for video conferencing or co-hosting.

  - Cons: Requires complex signaling and NAT traversal; not natively scalable (requires SFU/MCU); browser and hardware compatibility varies.

  - Use Cases: 1-on-1 or small group low-latency interactions; not suitable for CDN broadcasting.

| Protocol |Container | Transport | Latency  | Advantages                                   | Disadvantages                                      | Use Cases                     |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------- |
| RTMP     | FLV      | TCP       | 1–3s     | Low latency, CDN-friendly, widely compatible | Needs special player, TCP delay under poor network | PC streaming, interaction     |
| HTTP-FLV | FLV      | TCP(HTTP) | 1–3s     | HTTP-compatible, mobile-friendly             | Not supported by default in browsers               | Web-based live streaming      |
| HLS      | TS/CMAF  | TCP(HTTP) | 5-15s    | Great compatibility, scalable                | High latency, poor real-time performance           | VOD and general live          |
| LLS      | CMAF     | TCP(HTTP) | \<0.5s   | Ultra-low latency, end-to-end sync	          | Vendor-locked, requires specific SDK/player        | High-concurrency, low-latency |
| RTC      | RTP      | UDP/SRTP  | \<0.5s   | Real-time, P2P	                              | Poor scalability, hard to distribute via CDN       | Co-hosting, conferencing      |

## 4. Transcoding Profiles

**Encoder Options**:

- H.264: Most widely compatible, suitable for SD/HD.

- H.265: Higher compression (≈50% bitrate reduction at same quality), suitable for 4K/8K, but requires client support.

For users on poor networks, a `Narrowband HD profile` may be offered—maintains resolution while reducing bitrate.

Example transcoding profiles (actual strategy may vary by vendor):

|Profile |Resolution | FPS   |H.264Bitrate |H.265Bitrate  | Description                     |
| ------ | --------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| origin | -         | -     | -           | -            | Original stream                 |
| uhd    | 3840×2160 | 60fps | 6Mbps       | 3Mbps        | Ultra HD 4K                     |
| hd     | 1920×1080 | 45fps | 4Mbps       | 2Mbps        | Full HD 1080p                   |
| zuhd   | 1920×1080 | 45fps | 2Mbps       | 1Mbps        | Narrowband HD (low-bitrate FHD) |
