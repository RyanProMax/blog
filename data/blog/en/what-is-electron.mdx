## 1. [What's Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

![electron](/static/images/electron/01.png)

Electron is an open-source framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It embeds the Chromium rendering engine and Node.js runtime into a single executable, allowing developers to maintain a unified JavaScript codebase that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Which means Electron enables web front-end developers to build desktop applications quickly **"without native development experience"**.

### Main Process and Renderer Process

![electron-structure](/static/images/electron/02.png)

Electron inherits Chromium’s multi-process architecture. An Electron app consists of two types of processes: `the main process` and `the renderer process`.

- **Main Process**: Each Electron app has a single main process that serves as the entry point. It runs in a Node.js environment and has access to all Node.js APIs. The main process manages the app lifecycle and handles the creation and control of application windows. For example, it uses `BrowserWindow` to create browser windows and controls menus, dialogs, system tray, and more.

- **Renderer Process**: Each BrowserWindow has a corresponding renderer process, responsible for loading web pages and rendering the user interface. Code in the renderer process adheres to web standards and can utilize common front-end technology stacks. Multiple windows run in separate, isolated renderer processes, ensuring one crash doesn’t affect others.

### Integrating Chromium and Node.js

A key point: **Electron integrates Node.js’s event loop (libuv) into Chromium’s message loop, unifying their event handling mechanisms.**

Also, **_Chromium and Node.js share the same V8 engine._** During build time, Electron sets node_shared=true and disables Node.js's built-in V8, so both the main and renderer processes use Chromium’s bundled V8.

At runtime, Electron follows Chromium’s multi-process model: **_each renderer and the main process has its own V8 runloop and they are completely isolated._**

### Node.js Access in Renderer Process

When `nodeIntegration` is enabled, the renderer process has full access to Node.js APIs (like require, fs, path, etc.) and runs them within its own process:

- **Independent Runtime**: On startup, the renderer process is injected with Node.js global objects (process, Buffer, require, etc.) and initializes libuv and core Node modules. **_Each renderer process acts as both a Chromium sandbox and a full Node.js runtime._**

- **Local Execution**: When the renderer calls any Node.js API (e.g., file operations), it executes locally in the renderer's Node.js runtime, using libuv's I/O thread pool or event loop, and `does not` delegate to the main process.

- **IPC with Main Process**: The main and renderer processes communicate only via `ipcRenderer`/`ipcMain` for tasks like window control, privilege boundaries, or sandbox security. Node APIs themselves do not rely on IPC.

However, for security reasons, Electron officially recommends `disabling` nodeIntegration and using preload scripts with contextBridge to expose only necessary APIs, rather than enabling the full Node.js environment.
