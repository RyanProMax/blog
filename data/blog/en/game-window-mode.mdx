### 1. Exclusive Fullscreen

- **Definition**: The game completely takes over the display, bypassing the operating system's window compositor (such as Windows DWM), and can set its own resolution and refresh rate.

- **Advantages**:
  - Lowest input latency
  - Bypasses compositor, `highest GPU resource utilization`
  - Best support for VSYNC, HDR, FreeSync, more stable game frame rates

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Alt+Tab causes black screen or mode reload
    - Game releases exclusive control of the display > System takes over, switches back to desktop mode > When switching back to game, game regains exclusive control and reloads display settings
    - Specific manifestations: Brief black screen (usually 1-3 seconds), resolution switches between game mode and desktop mode, refresh rate may change
  - Multi-display switching interrupts experience
    - Specific manifestations: When switching to other displays, the game may briefly black screen/pause/stutter

- **Resource Usage**:
  - GPU efficient, unaffected by compositor
  - Lower CPU usage

- **Use Cases**:
  - Competitive gaming, high refresh rate competitive environments
  - Scenarios requiring extremely high frame rates and latency


### 2. Borderless Windowed

- **Definition**: Appears like fullscreen but is actually a borderless window, rendered through the system compositor.

- **Advantages**:
  - Fast Alt+Tab switching, no black screen
  - Notifications and overlays don't interfere
  - Suitable for streaming, multitasking

- **Disadvantages**:
  - System compositor still running, slightly increases CPU/GPU burden
  - FPS and response speed slightly lower than exclusive fullscreen
  
- **Resource Usage**:
  - CPU and GPU usage slightly higher than exclusive fullscreen, but modern Windows optimizations have narrowed the gap

- **Use Cases**:
  - Suitable for streaming, multitasking, balancing performance and smooth switching

### 3. Windowed Mode

- **Definition**: Regular resizable window with borders and title bar, can be displayed alongside other applications.

- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible multitasking, instant switching
  - Supports custom window sizes, compatible with older games

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Highest GPU/CPU consumption (needs to composite multiple windows)
  - Weaker performance, unstable frame rates

- **Resource Usage**:
  - Highest resource usage, system needs to handle window composition and background rendering, maximum overhead

- **Use Cases**:
  - Suitable for older games, when custom sizing is needed, or when frequent interaction with other desktop programs is required
