## 1. What Is a Stacking Context?

A stacking context is a three-dimensional rendering structure used by the browser to determine which elements appear in front of or behind others. Elements form stacking contexts based on their z-index, positioning, and specific CSS properties. The root element (`<html>`) naturally creates a stacking context, and certain conditions can trigger new ones:

- An element with position: absolute or relative and a specified z-index
- Use of properties like opacity < 1, transform, filter, or will-change
- When mix-blend-mode is set

_A new stacking context isolates its child elements from participating in the parent stacking order._


## 2. Rendering Layers vs. Compositing Layers

When rendering a page, browsers generally follow three phases:

1. Layout

2. Painting

3. Compositing

In the compositing phase, the browser may divide the page into multiple `compositing layers`, which are rendered independently via the GPU. These compositing layers are often derived from stacking contexts, but not always one-to-one.

By default, multiple stacking contexts may share a single rendering layer (also called a `compositing layer`)—usually `the root layer`. This is part of a browser performance optimization technique called `layer squashing`: minimizing the number of layers to avoid resource overhead.


## 3. When Is a New Compositing Layer Forced?

When an element is styled with GPU-accelerated properties (e.g., transform, will-change, \<video\>, \<canvas\>), the browser promotes it to a separate compositing layer to avoid redrawing the main layer frequently.

Importantly: If a lower element is promoted to a compositing layer (e.g., using will-change: transform), then any higher elements that need to visually overlay it may also be promoted, and eventually merged into a new shared compositing layer.

In short: compositing layers do not stack infinitely. The browser merges them intelligently to maintain correct visuals and prevent `layer explosion`.

## 4. Practical Recommendations

- Avoid overusing will-change or transform just to promote elements; excessive layering can backfire and bundle unrelated elements into the same layer, increasing memory usage.

- Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome's Layers panel) to inspect the layer tree for debugging and performance tuning.

## 5. Test Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>

    <style>
      .box {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        position: absolute;
      }
      .box1 {
        background-color: red;
        left: 100px;
        top: 100px;

        /* Promote to a separate compositing layer */
        /* transform: translateZ(0); */
      }
      .box2 {
        background-color: blue;
        left: 150px;
        top: 150px;
      }
      .box3 {
        background-color: yellow;
        left: 200px;
        top: 200px;
      }
      .box4 {
        background-color: green;
        left: 250px;
        top: 250px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="box box1"></div>
    <div class="box box2"></div>
    <div class="box box3"></div>
